# Introduction-to-feature-selection
This project applies feature selection techniques  to enhance model performance. Methods like SelectKBest, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and RFE with Cross-Validation were used. Statistical approaches like correlation analysis helped identify relevant features, followed by model optimization using cross-validation.
